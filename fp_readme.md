# RTG4 Development Kit FPGA Programming Files

This folder contains FlashPro Express **(v12.3)** projects for the RTG4 Development Kit Mi-V sample designs.

## FlashPro Express
The programming files contained under this folder were exported from the designs in the Libero_Projects folder in this repository. Select the desired programming .job file and program your device using FlashPro Express.
## Programming the Device using FlashPro Express
    1. Open FlashPro Express
    2. Select Project -> New Job Project from FlashPro Express Job   
    3. Browse to the Job file using, "Browse ...". The Job files are located in
       the FlashPro_Express_Project/Programming_Files directory
    4. Select the Job file, then select "Open"
    5. Select the FlashPro_Express_Project/Programming_Files  as the project location
    6. Connect the FPGA board to the computer using the FlashPro5 or Embedded FlashPro
    7. Turn on the board and select "Refreash/Rescan Programmers"
    8. Select the "RUN" button, status bar will change from IDLE to the percentage complete 
    9. Once complete the status bar will display "1 PROGRAMMER(S) PASSED"
    
## Design Features
The Libero designs include the following features:
* A MIV_RV32IMA_L1_AHB or MIV_RV32IMA_L1_AXI soft RISC-V processor.
* RISC-V debug block allowing on-target debug using SoftConsole.
* The operating frequency of the design is 50MHz.
* Target memory is LSRAM.
